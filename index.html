                        The group debuted in late 2020 with their debut single 'Black Mamba'. 
                        They then went on to release their very first EP 'Savage' in 2021 which landed immediately on the Billboard Top 200. 
                        The group's member Ningning was the first to enter SM Entertainment back in 2016 followed by Winter and Karina in 2017. 
                        The last member to join the group was Giselle in 2019.

                        Their first ever solo concert was held at Seoul's Jamsil Arena in February of 2023 for two sold-out nights. 
                        The band sung new and unreleased songs to 10,000 in-person fans a night, and thousands more who were livestreaming the second show from home.

                        The group have been dubbed as “representatives of the metaverse era,” according to Elle Magazine. 
                        Their music has hyperpop influences and their videos feature AI and other tech-based elements. 
                        L'Officiel Singapore explains: “Each member has a virtual representation that exists in a different dimension called FLAT: æ-Karina, æ-Winter, æ-Giselle, and æ-NingNing. 
                        These are called “æs” (pronounced like “eye”), and they are essentially Aespa's online avatars created from all the data members have uploaded to the internet.”

                        Their first fan account 'Aespa Universe' was created in May 2020 which now has more than 50,000 followers. 
                        It has become the hub for all things Aespa and the place for their fans 'MYs' to get all their new info!
