# Aespa Fan Page

This is my fan page for my favourite K-Pop group, called aespa. <br>
This website was created with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. <br>
You can access this site with the link "www.aespabyjefrich.com" <br>

## Features
1. Navigation Bar - On the website, you can navigate through all the content easily with the help of the navigation bar links. The position is fixed to the top of the page, even if the user scrolls. <br>
2. Hyperlinks - Hyperlinks are added to the site so the user can click on the text, and it will redirect to another page. For example, the group's official Instagram page. <br>
3. Embedded YouTube videos - The user can watch or listen to aespa's songs directly from the website without needing to open another tab or redirect to the YouTube page. <br>

## Content
On the site, you can listen to their variety of music releases and shows from the embedded YouTube videos. <br>
You can also view the members' list along with their official names, birthdays, up-to-date age, roles, and social media. <br>

### To-do lists (Works in the future)
1. Trivia Question - Who knows Aespa best?
2. Bias Question - Who does the user like most out of all the aespa members
3. Comments.

### My first official website made with passion and love. I hope you enjoy it!
